"""Operating profiles (CG-221): one named stop — economy, balanced, fast, or a garden's own —
that sets, together, worker and review concurrency, the tier map, the review and retro
difficulty, and the observation profile from CG-219 (see observe.py), so a person turns the
whole garden's spend up or down with one control instead of four separate config edits and a
restart. Offline like observe.py: no network, no state; `Scheduler` (scheduler/budget.py)
resolves the active stop and threads it through `effective()`.
