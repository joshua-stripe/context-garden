"""Checks as run records: the tick starts a check run and reaps it on a later tick.

A pre-PR check, a base probe or a pre-merge rebase-and-check used to run the product's test
suite in-process inside `tick()`, which held the web lock for a minute a pass (CG-182). Now
each is a `check` run — its own directory, started by one tick and reaped by a later one,
exactly like a review — so the tick only starts and reaps and never runs a product's suite
itself. The chain (pre-PR → base probe → rebase re-check) is a small state machine: each
stage stores the continuation the reap needs, and `reap_check` routes the results to it.

The git scaffolding a check needs (a mechanical rebase, a throwaway probe worktree) is cheap
and stays in the tick; only the check commands — the slow part — move to the run record. Check
runs are visible in the run list but do not consume the worker-mode `max_parallel` cap.
